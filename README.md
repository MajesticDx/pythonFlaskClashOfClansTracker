# pythonFlaskClashOfClansTracker

NOT OPTIMISED FOR USAGE. THIS IS JUST A UPLOAD FOR DEMONSTRATION.
I made this in school and it isn't well written or made for share.
Keep this in mind!

Clash of Clans Tracker Website

RUN main.py

Get your Clash of Clans API token and insert it after the bearer part in main.py

This will host a flaskWebsite local in which you can Track Clash of Clans Players Account Infos. Also integrated a Building Tracker where you can update your Upgrades and track your completion Level.
